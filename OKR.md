# Customer Pulse Priority Matrix

| Priority Tier | Who are they? | Why they need a constant pulse | Typical cadence | Recommended tools & platforms |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Tier 1 – Core owners of customer insight** | **Head of Strategy & Insight / Data / Research & Insights**<br>**Head of Product**<br>**Product Manager** | Their OKRs (feature adoption, NPS, churn) depend on real-time customer evidence; they must de-risk every roadmap or insight memo with fresh data. | Weekly (always-on dashboards, rolling interviews) | - Waal AI (smart digital interviews)<br>- Productboard / airfocus (roadmaps)<br>- Amplitude / Mixpanel (product analytics)<br>- Qualtrics / Medallia (VoC surveys)<br>- Dovetail / Condens (research repository)<br>- Tableau / Power BI (exec dashboards) |
| **Tier 2 – Growth & Innovation catalysts** | **Head of Strategy & Growth / Channels / Sales**<br>**Head of Strategy & Innovation**<br>**Chief Innovation Officer / Chief Strategy & Innovation Officer** | Revenue and new-market OKRs hinge on spotting shifts early (buyer needs, pricing signals, competitor moves). | Fortnightly–monthly pulse checks, cohort interviews, A/B tests | - Waal AI (rapid market sensing)<br>- Gong / Chorus (sales-call intelligence)<br>- SurveyMonkey Audience / Pollfish (quick market surveys)<br>- Brandwatch / Sprout Social (social sentiment)<br>- CB Insights / Crunchbase (competitive & funding signals)<br>- Airtable / Notion (experiment tracker) |
| **Tier 3 – Enterprise-wide stewards** | **Head of Strategy (generic)**<br>**Head of Strategy & Transformation / Execution / Performance**<br>**Group Head of Strategy & Transformation** | Need VoC and market data to validate long-range strategy, but mostly consume curated insight rather than gather it themselves. | Quarterly sensing studies, analyst briefings, annual NPS | - Gartner / Forrester research portals<br>- McKinsey Panorama, IBISWorld (macro & industry)<br>- CEO Dashboard in Tableau / Power BI<br>- Waal AI pulse-summary modules<br>- Salesforce Customer 360 / Snowflake (consolidated data) |
| **Tier 4 – Partnership & Ecosystem shapers** | **Head of Strategy & Partnerships**<br>**Head of Strategy & Channels** | Customer sentiment guides which alliances deliver value and where channel friction exists. | Event-driven feedback (post-launch/campaign), semi-annual partner reviews | - PartnerStack / Impartner (PRM & performance)<br>- Gainsight PX / Catalyst (joint-customer health)<br>- Waal AI (partner/client interviews)<br>- Qualtrics Joint NPS surveys<br>- Tableau / Power BI partner dashboards |

## How to Act on This

1. **Start with Tier 1** champions – they typically have budget authority for continuous discovery tools.
2. **Package VoC outputs** at the right altitude (deep analytics for Tier 1 and 2, exec-ready digests for Tier 3).
3. **Embed shared tooling** (e.g., Waal AI into Tableau) to keep insights flowing across tiers without extra lift.
